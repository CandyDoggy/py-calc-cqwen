## Tech Stack

| Component | Library | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **UI Framework** | PyQt6 + Fluent Widgets | Modern, animated interface |
| **Math Engine** | SymPy | Symbolic mathematics, algebra, calculus |
| **Numerical** | NumPy | Array operations, linear algebra |
| **Scientific** | SciPy | Advanced functions (integration, optimization, statistics) |

## Notes

- The calculator uses **SymPy** for symbolic math, ensuring accurate results
- **PyQt6-Fluent-Widgets** provides the modern Windows 11 aesthetic
- All calculations are automatically saved to `calculation_history.json`
- Theme preference is stored in `settings.json`
